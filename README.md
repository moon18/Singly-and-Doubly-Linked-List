# Singly and Doubly Linked List Implementation

## Singly and Doubly Linked List
Python implementation of Singly and Doubly Linked list along with an exercises from [Open Data Structures by Pat Morin](http://opendatastructures.org/) book for practice. These include exercises **3.7, 3.9, and 3.12** given in the file `dl_list_exercise.py`. The test cases are also given in `test_dllist.py` and `test_sllist.py`.

## MinDeque Implemenation 
In order to furthur our understanding of the two given data structures I have performed **Exercise 3.16**.
>Design and implement a MinDeque data structure that can store comparable elements and supports all the deque operations add first(x), add_last(x) remove_first(), remove_last() and size(), and the min() operation, which returns the minimum value currently stored in the data structure. All operations should run in constant amortized time. 

Over here amortized means to analyze the algorithms complexity but also taking into account its worse case. You can read more over [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11102585/what-is-amortized-analysis-of-algorithms)
